## General Info
Pybo is a bot running on the Discord API. Although I initially built Pybo as a way to inform people about cryptocurrencies and their prices, Pybo can also help moderate and entertain community members.

For those not familiar with 'Discord,' Discord is an online messaging software that puts a heavy emphasis on 'servers,' or communities. Users of this app can join a server and chat with everyone in text channels which can also be divided into their own categories.

As servers continually accept more members, the admins and moderators can have trouble keeping their members in check. To alleviate their stress, bots have been built to help automate some moderation duties.

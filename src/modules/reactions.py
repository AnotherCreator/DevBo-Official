        # Method 1: Maybe some sort of array to keep a list of users who reacted
        #           - Then a loop that goes through each index to check if user is in the array
        #           - If user is in array, ignore reaction
        #           - If user is not in array, add the reaction

        # Method 2: A JSON file might be the way to go to temporarily keep track of users who reacted with the message
        #           - Keep a list of users who reacted and add them accordingly
        #           - If a user unreacts to the message remove them from the list
        #           - Once the reaction has reached the threshold, the message cannot be pinned again
        #                   even if all the users unreacted and reacts again
